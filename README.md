---------------------------------------------
🚀 Thrilled to share my very first app built with Flutter, Dart, and Hive – now live as a release APK!

What started as a simple ✅ to-do list app grew into a full wellness + productivity companion:

🕌 Tasbih Counter – 60+ dhikr & duʿā’
🙏 Daily Prayer Checklist – auto reset at midnight
💧 Hydration Log – track your daily water intake
📝 Task Tracker – lightweight & offline
🎨 20+ Custom Themes – from soft dark to fun character styles
🎥 Random Cinematic Splash Videos – new intro every cold start

💡 Through this project I learned:

📱 Mobile dev with Flutter & Dart

🗂 Offline storage with Hive

🎭 Theming, animations, and state management

📦 Building and shipping an APK release

Proud of this first step in mobile development.
